Projet Factory Frenzy
Our mission was to create “Factory Frenzy”, a game inspired by Fall Guys. The project consists of a race with platforms and traps, divided into two applications: level editing in VR and multiplayer play on a classic PC. We therefore carried out a POC to assess the project's viability.
